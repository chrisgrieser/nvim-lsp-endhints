Minimal plugin that displays LSP inlay hints at the end of the line, rather than
within the line.

## Installation
**Requirements:**
- nvim >= 0.10
- LSP client that supports inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`)
- Inlay hints enabled in the config of the LSP

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-lsp-endhints",
	event = "LspAttach",
	opts = {}, -- required, even if empty
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-lsp-endhints",
}
```

## Configuration

The `.setup()` call is required.

```lua
-- default settings
require("lsp-endhints").setup {
	icons = {
		type = "Û∞úÅ ",
		parameter = "Û∞è™ ",
		offspec = "ÔìÉ ", -- hint kind not defined in official LSP spec
		unknown = "Ôäú ", -- hint kind is nil
	},
	label = {
		padding = 1,
		marginLeft = 0,
		bracketedParameters = true,
	},
	autoEnableHints = true,
}
```

The hints use the default highlight group `LspInlayHint`.

## Usage
By default, the plugin automatically enables inlay hints when attaching to an
LSP, there is nothing to do other than loading the plugin.

All regular inlay hint functions like `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable()` work the
same as before. Use them [as described in the Neovim
documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable())
to enable/disable/toggle hints manually.

You can switch the behaviour of the inlay hints using the `enable`, `disable`
and `toggle` functions exposed by this plugin:

```lua
-- inlay hints will show at the end of the line. default.
require("lsp-endhints").enable() 

-- inlay hints will show as if the plugin was not installed.
require("lsp-endhints").disable() 

-- toggle between the two modes above.
require("lsp-endhints").toggle() 
```

## Background
- [The LSP specification stipulates that inlay hints have a fixed position in
  the line, which Neovim core follows.](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28261#issuecomment-2194659088)
- However, for many people, hints being positioned within the line disturbs the
  flow of vim motions. This is particularly troublesome for languages with long
  type hints, such as TypeScript.
- [nvim-inlayhint](https://github.com/lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim) did pretty
  much the same thing for nvim < 0.10, but it is archived by now. Other than
  being maintained, `nvim-lsp-endhints` just overrides the
  `textDocument/inlayHint` handler introduced in nvim 0.10, resulting in a much
  simpler and more maintainable implementation (~170 LoC instead of ~1000 LoC).

## FAQ

### How to display hints only for the current line?
That is not supported by the plugin. However, [it only takes a small snippet to
implement it
yourself.](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28261#issuecomment-2130338921)
(Note that the linked snippet is not compatible with this plugin.)

### How to enable inlay hints for a language?

> [!NOTE]
> Not all LSPs support inlay hints. The following list is not exhaustive,
> there are more LSPs that support inlay hints. Please refer to your LSP's
> documentation.

```lua
-- lua-ls
require("lspconfig").lua_ls.setup {
	settings = {
		Lua = {
			hint = { enable = true },
		},
	},
}

-- tsserver
local inlayHints = {
	includeInlayParameterNameHints = "all",
	includeInlayParameterNameHintsWhenArgumentMatchesName = false,
	includeInlayFunctionParameterTypeHints = true,
	includeInlayVariableTypeHints = true,
	includeInlayVariableTypeHintsWhenTypeMatchesName = false,
	includeInlayPropertyDeclarationTypeHints = true,
	includeInlayFunctionLikeReturnTypeHints = true,
	includeInlayEnumMemberValueHints = true,
}
require("lspconfig").tsserver.setup {
	settings = {
		typescript = {
			inlayHints = inlayHints,
		},
		javascript = {
			inlayHints = inlayHints,
		},
	},
}

-- gopls
require("lspconfig").gopls.setup {
	settings = {
		hints = {
			rangeVariableTypes = true,
			parameterNames = true,
			constantValues = true,
			assignVariableTypes = true,
			compositeLiteralFields = true,
			compositeLiteralTypes = true,
			functionTypeParameters = true,
		},
	},
}

-- clangd
require("lspconfig").clangd.setup {
	settings = {
		clangd = {
			InlayHints = {
				Designators = true,
				Enabled = true,
				ParameterNames = true,
				DeducedTypes = true,
			},
			fallbackFlags = { "-std=c++20" },
		},
	},
}
```
