INSTALLATION               *nvim-lsp-endhints-nvim-lsp-endhints--installation*

**Requirements** - nvim >= 0.10 - LSP client that supports inlay hints
(`textDocument/inlayHint`) - Inlay hints enabled in the config of the LSP

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-lsp-endhints",
        event = "LspAttach",
        opts = {}, -- required, even if empty
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-lsp-endhints",
    }
<


CONFIGURATION             *nvim-lsp-endhints-nvim-lsp-endhints--configuration*

The `.setup()` call is required.

>lua
    -- default settings
    require("lsp-endhints").setup {
        icons = {
            type = "󰜁 ",
            parameter = "󰏪 ",
            offspec = " ", -- hint kind not defined in official LSP spec
            unknown = " ", -- hint kind is nil
        },
        label = {
            padding = 1,
            marginLeft = 0,
            sameKindSeparator = ", ",
        },
        autoEnableHints = true,
    }
<

The hints use the default highlight group `LspInlayHint`.


USAGE                             *nvim-lsp-endhints-nvim-lsp-endhints--usage*

By default, the plugin automatically enables inlay hints when attaching to an
LSP, there is nothing to do other than loading the plugin.

All regular inlay hint functions like `vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable()` work the
same as before. Use them |as described in the Neovim documentation| to
enable/disable/toggle hints manually.

You can switch between displaying inlay hints at the end of the line (this
plugin) and within the line (Neovim default) by using the `enable`, `disable`
and `toggle` functions:

>lua
    -- inlay hints will show at the end of the line (default)
    require("lsp-endhints").enable()
    
    -- inlay hints will show as if the plugin was not installed
    require("lsp-endhints").disable()
    
    -- toggle between the two
    require("lsp-endhints").toggle()
<


BACKGROUND                   *nvim-lsp-endhints-nvim-lsp-endhints--background*

- The LSP specification stipulates that inlay hints have a fixed position in
    the line, which Neovim core follows. <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28261#issuecomment-2194659088>
- However, for many people, hints being positioned within the line disturbs the
    flow of vim motions. This is particularly troublesome for languages with long
    type hints, such as TypeScript.
- nvim-inlayhint <https://github.com/lvimuser/lsp-inlayhints.nvim> did pretty
    much the same thing for nvim < 0.10, but it is archived by now. Other than
    being maintained, `nvim-lsp-endhints` just overrides the
    `textDocument/inlayHint` handler introduced in nvim 0.10, resulting in a much
    simpler and more maintainable implementation (~250 LoC instead of ~1000 LoC).


FAQ                                 *nvim-lsp-endhints-nvim-lsp-endhints--faq*


HOW TO DISPLAY HINTS ONLY FOR THE CURRENT LINE? ~

That is not supported by the plugin. However, it only takes a small snippet to
implement it yourself.
<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28261#issuecomment-2130338921> (Note
that the linked snippet is not compatible with this plugin.)


HOW TO ENABLE INLAY HINTS FOR A LANGUAGE? ~


  [!NOTE] Not all LSPs support inlay hints. The following list is not exhaustive,
  there are more LSPs that support inlay hints. Please refer to your LSP’s
  documentation.
